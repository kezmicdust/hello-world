Thoughts and ideas about scripts and programs

This is Keith here. I'm very new to coding, but I'm getting better all the time. At the moment, I'm only writing in Python, but I may
learn another language (like C++) eventually. My main focus is creating an eyetracking game for Stephy to see if we can improve her
vision. Coding will also be useful for work for plotting (matplotlib), image analysis (Jython for ImageJ) and using a Raspberry Pi for
timelapse imaging and videos.
